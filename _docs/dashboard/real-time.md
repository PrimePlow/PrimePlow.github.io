The dashboard provides real-time performance metrics during an active snow event. You can review overall event statistics for previous events, but many of the features are only active during a snow event.

### Event Details
The top portion of the dashboard shows key event information (Event Name, Event Start Date, End Date, Duration, Average Temperature, Precipitation).

### Event Statistics
This table and chart displays percent complete by priority and a break down of treatment (in miles) over several recent time frames (last hour, 3 hours, and since the beginning of the event).

### Event Trends
This chart shows how percent complete has changed over time. This allows you to measure your average cycle time for each priority (i.e. typically three hours of work will result in 50% of priority 1 streets receiving treatment).

Each line represents a priority, clicking on the line will show the percent complete recorded at that moment in time.

### Current Activity
This table displays many vehicles in your fleet have their ignition on and how many routes have a vehicle deployed on them.

### Vehicles By Priority
This table shows what priority your vehicles are currently deployed on.

### Last Vehicle Message
This is a simple table that updates whenever a new vehicle breadcrumb is received by the system. You can sort the table by each of the columns. The first column (gear) will highlight blue and spin when a recent breadcrumb message is received. Please note this only loads messages received after the dashboard is opened.

### Routes
This table shows the current number of passes, and the total number of passes performed on each route during the selected snow event. The "Current Passes" field indicates how many times a street segment in that particular route has been visited. The "Total Passes" field is one less than the "Current Passes" field to indicate the number of passes while no trucks are treating in that route.
