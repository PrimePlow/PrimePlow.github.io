The Historical Vehicle view provides tools to search for vehicle breadcrumbs captured over time. There are three basic search filters that can be applied to historical vehicles (**Date**, **Vehicles**, **Location**). You are required to provide a date filter for all historic searches. The results of your search will be shown in a table and within the map. The table and map are interactive, clicking on a record in the table will pan the map and clicking on a breadcrumb from the map will highlight the record in the table. The results table also allows you to sort results on any of the columns (Vehicle, Role, Time, Heading, Speed, Sensor 1, Sensor 2).

**Notes:**
* You can combine filters to find specific breadcrumbs of interest.
* Breadcrumb searches are limited to 10,000 records. If you select a large amount of breadcrumbs you will receive the first 10,000 breadcrumbs that meet your criteria.


### Date Filter
The date filter is required for **_all_** historical searches.
