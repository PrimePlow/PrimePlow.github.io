The message management page gives your organization control over the messages displayed in the public application. There are two types of messages to be displayed:
1. **Static Messages:** These messages appear on the right side panel of the public application. These are intended to be used for more permanent messages that provide general information.
2. **Scrolling Messages:** These messages scroll across the public map and are intended to be updated frequently to provide the public with up to date status messages about each snow event.

The following functions are available for both static and scrolling messages:

* **Change Message Order:** Click and drag the messages to re-order the messages.
* **Edit Message:** Click on the message text to edit the message. Click away from the message and your message is automatically saved.
* **Toggle Messages On / Off:** Store common messages and turn them on / off as needed.
* **Delete Messages:** Remove messages you don't need.
* **Add Messages:** Create a new message from scratch.
* **Preview:** Shows a preview of the messages that are turned on.
