The vehicle management interface provides a list of all vehicles to be displayed within Prime Plow. Filter tools are available to find a specific vehicle in your fleet.

### Add Vehicle

Use this tool to add new vehicles to your fleet. Please note your VIN must match the VIN registered with Networkfleet.

### Change Role

![Vehicles](/img/vehicles_role.png)

Vehicles can be set to have a sensor or have no sensor. A vehicle with no sensor may be marked as such to ensure that it will still mark roads as treated.

### Change Status

Changing the status will adjust how the vehicle is used within Prime Plow

* **Treating:** Vehicle fully operational and will show treatment and be used for statistics.
* **Not Treating:** Vehicle is operational, but assigned to other work. Any breadcrumbs with the plow down or spreader on will **_NOT_** show treatment or be used for statistics.
* **In Maintenance:** Vehicle has a mechanical issue or is reporting false data. Any breadcrumbs with the plow down or spreader on will **_NOT_** show treatment or be used for statistics.
* **Unassigned:** Vehicle does not have a status set. Any breadcrumbs with the plow down or spreader on will **_NOT_** show treatment or be used for statistics.
* **Retired:** Vehicle is no longer in use. Any breadcrumbs with the plow down or spreader on will **_NOT_** show treatment or be used for statistics.
